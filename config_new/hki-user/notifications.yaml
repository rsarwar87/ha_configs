# This is the notifications page, you can edit notifications that are
# shown on the frontend in this file. This works with conditional cards.
# What this means is that the conditions need to be be met before these
# cards are shown. When there are more entities/states in a conditional
# card it will always be an 'AND' condition, it will never be an 'OR'
# condition. Edit the conditions, entities and notification content to
# your own likings.

# MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE NOTIFICATION OR YOU WILL GET AN ERROR.
# IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE NOTIFICATIONS TURN IT OFF IN THE SETTINGS!
